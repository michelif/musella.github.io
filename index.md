I am a Data Scientist and PhD in High Energy Physics. In my work, I use machine learning
to investigate the nature of fundamental interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

I like playing with all sorts of data, text, images, clicks, time series... I recently
started this blog to collect my
experiments in applying machine learning algorithms to these datasets.  
Feel free to contact me on twitter or linkedin if you have any question or suggestion on
the content.
