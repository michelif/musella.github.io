title:  "Forecasting restaurants turnovers"
---

At the beginnign of the year a food-hackaton was organized by Opendata.ch in the context of the the AMLD 2018
conference in Lausanne.  

I participated to it and it was a super fun experience!! I have worked with a nice group of
data scientits and software enegeneers to build a demo application for the Prognolite
startup in Zurich.  

[Prognolite](https://prognolite.com) offers a guest and turnout forecasting service to restaurants
that exploit this information to optimize their supply chain.

During the hackaton we helped the prognolite people to build a first prototype of the
predicting model. The model was trained on historical data from a sample restaurant and
used wheather forecasting, calendar data, and running rolling time windows to predict the
the total turnover and the number of served meals in upcoming weeks.

The project was actually selected as one of the two winning projects for the hackaton, and
the prognolite team recently launched their product, building on what we came up during
those two days.
