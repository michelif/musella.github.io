I am a particle physicist working at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider.  

I am passionate about machine learning, and I like to follow the latest trends in the
field.  

In this blog I will collect my experiments with the application of machine learning
algorithms to different kinds of problems (not related to high energy physics).
